# Hello, I'm Nikoloz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at the **University of Richmond** pursuing a Bachelor of Science in **Computer Science and Mathematics**, with a minor in **Data Science and Statistics**. I grew up in **Tbilisi, Georgia**, and now find myself exploring the world, one line of code at a time. In my free time, I enjoy playing **Water Polo**, climbing, staying active, and of course, coding. I love taking on interesting and challenging projects, and this GitHub profile is a testament to that passion.

Each project in my repository is representative of a small part of me. Feel free to explore them, and let me know what you think! Note that not all of the things I've worked on are public and therefore are lacking from this corner.

Currently I am:
- In my third year of undergrad, and I'm taking Machine Learning, Database Systems, and some main [courses](https://cs.richmond.edu/Academics/courses/index.html).
- Working under Dr. Shweta Ware on the [SASSEMA](https://cs.richmond.edu/research/independent-study.html) development team, mainly concerned with distribution as of late.
- Developing a Tron(link coming soon) City 3D space on the web.
- Polishing a couple of my existing projects which you can find in this profile.

## Last Semester
- I was abroad in Budapest studying at [AIT](https://www.ait-budapest.com/).
- Visited a dozen countries in Europe!
- Lost my right airpod ðŸ«¤.


## Fun Facts
- I have been playing WaterPolo since middle school, and am on the UofR [WaterPolo](https://www.instagram.com/spiderswaterpolo/) team.
- I enjoy playing Poker and BlackJack, and studying ways of making them profitable.
- I enjoy skiing, and want to learn surfing and skydiving ASAP.
